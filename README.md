# Measuring NBA success: salary concentration and performance

In the US film ‘Moneyball’ a coach takes a struggling Major League Baseball team on a record winning streak by
choosing a team of players based on statistical analysis and value for money. The lesson from the film is that a team does not
necessarily need to be filled with (expensive) superstars to find success. Taking inspiration from the film and the broader
concept of making decisions in sport based on data analysis (a concept called sabermetrics popularised by baseball statistician
Bill James), we analyse a set of National Basketball Association (NBA) data over a period of 12 years (2005-2017) to
consider the drivers of team success. Specifically, we are interested in whether a player’s salary is a reasonable indicator of
their contribution to a team’s success and whether the highest earning players in a team are the most important contributors.

The performance contributions of the two or three most highly paid players in the team appear to matter most for a team’s
success. Offensive performance metrics such as field goal percentage, points scored and assists tend to contribute most to
team wins and their contribution tends to increase in a player’s share of the salary pool. In addition, there is some evidence
that higher turnovers, including outside the most highly paid players in a team, is correlated with teams that win fewer games.
In addition, teams that concentrate their salary expenditure on fewer players tend to win fewer games on average though the
magnitude of this effect is not particularly large. Together these findings support the notion of the ‘big three’ in basketball,
where a team’s success is reflected mostly in the performance of the two or three best players in the team.
